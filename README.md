# Epidemic Simulation with Graphs

## Overview

This project simulates the spread of an epidemic within a population using graph data structures. The simulation considers factors such as disease transmission, recovery, and vaccination to model the dynamic interactions among individuals.

## Features

- **Graph Representation**: Individuals are represented as nodes, and connections between them form a network, reflecting real-world interactions.
- **Dynamic Simulation**: The simulation evolves over time, capturing the transmission of the disease, recovery, and the impact of vaccination.
- **Visualization**: The program provides visualizations to illustrate the changing states of individuals in the population at each simulation step.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (version x.x)
- Required Python packages: networkx, matplotlib

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MonishCreate/Epidemic.git
cd Epidemic
